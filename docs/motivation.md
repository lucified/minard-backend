When building interactive data visualisations targeted for publication—and,
more generally, when communicating for influence and impact—early and constant
feedback is essential. Feedback is needed both inside and across the development
and journalistic teams.

We’ve come to realize that easy access to feedback—especially when the teams
work collaboratively across multiple locations—needs to be built into the development
process. As a solution, we propose continuous feedback (CF) for online data visualisations.

Continuous feedback can be seen as an extension of continuous integration (CI),
where an automated build process is integrated with the version control system.
The system automatically builds a new version of the visualisation with each
update to the code base, and makes the interactive visualisation available to all
stakeholders for review.

With Minard, we aim to provide the basic building
blocks for a continuous feedback system.
